For this, I used Git to clone the repository from https://github.com/suraiya-jabeen/Week_Group_Assignment5.git. Then I launched the Visual Studio code terminal, and then I used the cd command to move to the directory folder. I wrote run the go run main.go command to proceed. Two files that i have added

.substract.go file has substract code for substract function
.substract_test.go file has test cases to check 

Here are the outputs
PS C:\Users\surai\OneDrive\Desktop\Software Quality and Testing\Week 12\Week_Group_Assignment5> go test -v
=== RUN   TestSubstract
--- PASS: TestSubstract (0.00s)
PASS
ok
