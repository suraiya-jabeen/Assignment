For this, I used Git to clone the repository from https://github.com/suraiya-jabeen/Week_Group_Assignment5.git. Then I launched the Visual Studio code terminal, and then I used the cd command to move to the directory folder. I wrote run the go run main. go command to proceed.

what is needed!

In case you haven't done so, install Go on your computer. A new directory called Week4_go_assignment should be created. Launch Command Prompt and use cd to get to the Week4_go_assignment folder. Create a Go file called "main.go" that has the welcome you want. Run the go-run main.go Command to see how your greeting is received.
